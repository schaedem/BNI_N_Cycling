# BNI_N_Cycling
 
## This repository contains soil datasets associated with Schaedel et al. (in review) : Nitrogen cycling functional gene abundance and potential activity in novel perennial forage cropping systems in Rwanda
### Data and processing scripts for conventional and high-throuphut qPCR can be found at https://github.com/schaedem/NiCE_Chip_Paper

The goal of this project was to:

1. Test BNI under field conditions
2. Determine the impact of a legume intercrop on BNI and soil Fertility
3. Identify genetic drivers of NP and DEA across time

The data in this repository derives from bulk soil sampling from replicated trials in Rwanda (Nyagatare, Rubona).
Field trials were sampled for a total of 6 timepoints:
  T1 (forage anthesis, dry season) : September 2020
  T2 (forage regrowth, dry season) : October 2020
  T3 (forage anthesis, early rainy season) : November 2020
  T4 (forage regrowth, early rainy season) : December 2020
  T5 (forage anthesis, rainy season) : January 2021
  T6 (forage regrowth, rainy season) : February/March 2021

T1 samples have ID numbers in the 200s.
T2 samples have ID numbers in the 300s.
T3 samples have ID numbers in the 400s.
T4 samples have ID numbers in the 500s.
T5 samples have ID numbers in the 600s.
T6 samples have ID numbers in the 700s.

Treatments (7), 4 replicates:
Maize monoculture, maize + Desmodium distortum intercrop
Napier grass monoculture, Napier + D. distortum intercrop
Brachiaria cv. Mulato II monoculture, Brachiaria + D. distortum intercrop
D. distortum monocrop

Laboratory procedures: the same set of procedures was collected on all soil samples.
pH, GWC
